## Introduction

Graphs are powerful structures used to represent relationships between entities. From social networks to transportation systems, graph algorithms play a crucial role in analyzing and optimizing these structures. However, selecting the right algorithm can be challenging. Graphtune simplifies this task by utilizing machine learning techniques to recommend the best algorithm based on your graph's characteristics.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection**: Uses XGBoost to analyze graph features and recommend suitable algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind for easy interaction.
- **Comprehensive Algorithm Library**: Supports various graph algorithms including BFS, Dijkstra, and more.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides insights into the performance of selected algorithms.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes tools to visualize graphs and algorithm outputs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Graphtune, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Javirivera24/Graphtune.git
   cd Graphtune
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and Execute**: 
   You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Javirivera24/Graphtune/releases). Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the program.

## Usage

Once you have Graphtune set up, you can start using it to select graph algorithms. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Input Your Graph**: Provide the graph data in a supported format (e.g., adjacency list, edge list).
2. **Analyze Features**: Graphtune will analyze the graph structure and extract relevant features.
3. **Get Recommendations**: The tool will suggest the best algorithms based on the analysis.
4. **Run the Selected Algorithm**: Execute the recommended algorithm and review the results.

## Algorithms Supported

Graphtune supports a variety of graph algorithms, including:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A fundamental algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
- **Graph Coloring**: A method of assigning labels to graph vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same label.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
- **Network Flow Algorithms**: Such as Ford-Fulkerson for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.

## How It Works

Graphtune employs a machine learning model based on XGBoost to analyze graph features. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Feature Extraction**: The tool extracts features from the input graph, such as the number of nodes, edges, density, and degree distribution.
2. **Model Prediction**: Using the trained XGBoost model, Graphtune predicts which algorithms are likely to perform best based on the extracted features.
3. **Recommendation Output**: The tool presents a ranked list of algorithms along with expected performance metrics.
